## Why not YouTube-unlisted as the share backend?

Verified against Google's own docs (July 2026): videos uploaded through an **unverified
YouTube API project are locked to private** — viewers can't open them, and there is **no
appeal** (the only paths are a formal YouTube API audit of the app, or manual re-upload).
Uploads also sit in a dedicated ~**100 uploads/day per project** quota bucket shared by every
user of the app, and the `youtube.upload` OAuth scope requires Google app verification.
That breaks "record → link works instantly" for an installable open-source tool, so Open Loom
uses storage **you** own instead. Full analysis: `docs/SHARING.md`.
